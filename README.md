## Weather Dashboard
## By Travis Gray

I was instructed to create this weather app by pulling API keys from a weather website and displaying it on my webpage. I had to pull the API key for the UV index separately since it used a different API key. The history bar will show the most recent search, store the most recent search in local storage, and then display it upon the web page refresh.

I uploaded my own icons from another website and linked them directly into the page. The API pulls icon codes but doesn't have a picture linked to it directly.
